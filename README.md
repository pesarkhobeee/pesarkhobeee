**I'm a software engineer and open source enthusiast!**

My journey began as a full-stack web developer, and I've since transitioned to the world of DevOps. While I enjoy creating software (having built numerous small programs over the past 15 years!), I'm particularly proud of my contributions to the Iranian open source community :)
